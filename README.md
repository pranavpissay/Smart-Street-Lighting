# Smart Street Lighting System  
An energy-efficient automation project using Arduino and LDR sensor to control street lights based on ambient light conditions.

## 💡 Overview  
This project provides an automatic street lighting solution that turns street lights ON/OFF based on surrounding light levels. By using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and Arduino, the system detects ambient brightness and eliminates unnecessary energy consumption. It is ideal for smart cities and rural infrastructure where power saving and automation are crucial.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Arduino UNO / ESP32  
- Arduino IDE (C++)  
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)  
- Resistors, LEDs (for demo), Relay Module (optional for AC control)

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Automatically switches street lights ON during low light (night)  
- Turns OFF street lights during daylight  
- Real-time light sensing via LDR  
- Low-cost and easy to deploy  
- Scalable for use in rural and smart city applications  
- Can be extended with motion sensors or IoT controls
